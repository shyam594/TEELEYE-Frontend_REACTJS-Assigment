3.)Invalid prop types are being used in the 'propTypes' definition.
4.)The 'shape' definition in the 'propTypes' is missing a closing brace.
5.)The 'defaultProps' are set to 'null' for the 'items' prop, but it should be set to an empty array instead.
6.)'PropTypes.shape' is missing in the 'propTypes' for the shape definition of each item.
7.)The 'defaultProps' for 'WrappedListComponen't are missing.
8.)A unique 'key' prop should be added to the 'SingleListItem' component to help React identify which items have changed and need to be re-rendered.
